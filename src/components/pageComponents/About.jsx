      <h1>Who am I?</h1>
      <p>A recent bootcamp grad of DevMountain Dallas where I learned the fundamentals of Javascript front-end and back-end development. 
      <br />
      It was a incredibly challenging yet wondeful experience that shaped me into a developer in pursuit of a long term position in the field. 
      <br />
      After a fast 16 weeks, I can confidently say I have a deeper understanding of client-side and server-side programming 
      <br />
      which I learned through various projects.</p>
